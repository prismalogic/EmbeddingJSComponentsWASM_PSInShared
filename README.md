# Embedding JS DatePicker Component in Uno Platform

This is just an example of how JS DatePicker (Flatpickr: https://flatpickr.js.org/) can be used used in WASM project of Uno Platform.

It shows CalendarDatePicker control being used for UWP while Flatpickr is used on WASM. Hope it helps understand how to use platform specific code with conditionals with events and actual examples.

This project uses the code as described here: https://platform.uno/docs/articles/interop/wasm-javascript-3.html
